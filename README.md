# Over-Under-Game
This is a text-based game written in Java. The player can select from three game modes in the main menu where they guess whether the next random number will be higher or lower than the current one. You can play by yourself and set a high score, play against a friend, or play against the computer.  

Ideas for further improvements for this game: 
1) Instead of choosing from 1 to 13, create an ArrayList of the standard 52 card playing deck. The deck is shuffled, cards are drawn, and the players guess
   whether the next card will be higher or lower. The playing cards will be objects instantiated from a PlayingCard.java class file with private "rank" and 
   "suit" attributes. 
2) Implement a more substantial AI for the computer where the computer calculates which option between "lower" and "higher" is more statistically
   likely and goes with that option.
